# Mini Game Arcade 

## 1. PROJECT SCOPE

### Main Goal

As a team, we’ve decided to create a Mini Game Arcade using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our goal is to build a lightweight, browser-friendly platform that hosts a couple of simple yet engaging games. We’re focusing on making everything visually clean, responsive across devices, and easy to navigate.

### Key Features

1. A single landing page that acts as the gateway to all the games.
2. At least two fully working games, most likely Rock Paper Scissors, Tic Tac Toe or Whack-a-Mole.
3. A consistent user experience and layout across all game screens.
4. Scoreboards or visual result messages in each game.
5. Fully responsive design that adjusts well on both laptops and smartphones.

### Out of Scope (For Now)

1. Saving scores or player data (persistent storage).
2. Login systems or any sort of user authentication.
3. Real-time multiplayer features or online connectivity between users.

## 2. MILESTONES AND TIMELINE

### Phase 1: Sprint Kickoff

1. We finalised which games we’ll build and assigned tasks accordingly.
2. Set up a GitHub repository with separate folders for each game.

### Phase 2: Game Structure with Copilot

1. At least one game will have its core logic written with help from GitHub Copilot.
2. We aim to build a basic UI layout for this game and test its functionality.

### Phase 3: Mid-Sprint Demo + Feedback

1. Two games should be playable with working features and basic styling.
2. Smooth navigation from the landing page to each game should be functional.
3. We’ll conduct small internal tests and fix any major bugs we find.

### Final Phase: Sprint Wrap-Up

1. All games will be polished and deployed, possibly using GitHub Pages or Netlify.
2. If time permits, we’ll include a third bonus game.
3. Final documentation and a short walkthrough will be prepared.

## 4. ANTICIPATED CHALLENGES AND STRATEGIES

### Possible Challenges

1. Combining different coding styles into one unified experience might get tricky.
2. We may run into time constraints, especially if debugging takes longer than expected.
3. Making sure everything works on both desktop and mobile can be time-consuming.

### Our Strategy to Handle These

1. We'll keep our code modular and follow a common folder and file structure.
2. After every feature update, we'll test to catch issues early.
3. If anyone gets stuck, the rest of us will step in to help.
4. To avoid confusion, we'll strictly use GitHub branches and pull requests with proper review before merging anything.
